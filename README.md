# CS 111 Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of the CS 111 course at Rutgers University. The projects are written in Java and demonstrate the programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms taught throughout the course. Each project folder contains a detailed description of the project's objectives, requirements, and implementation details.

# Important Notice:
Ensure that you download the "inputOutput" folder and place it in the same directory as the programs you intend to execute. Several programs in this repository rely on the classes contained within the "inputOutput" folder for their proper functioning.

## Projects Overview
Below is a brief overview of the projects included in the "CS 111 Projects" folder:

1. Polygon Transformer
This Java program is a library of static methods designed to perform geometric transformations on polygons, such as scaling, translation, and rotation. The program requires a strong understanding of linear algebra, trigonometry, and familiarity with Java's Math class to work with angles in radians and degrees. This project demonstrates the ability to create reusable code for complex mathematical operations and is suitable for those with intermediate Java experience.

2. Weather Generator
The Weather Generator is a Java program that simulates and analyzes weather forecasts, focusing on predicting whether a day will be "wet" (with measurable precipitation) or "dry." The program requires knowledge of probability, statistics, and data manipulation in Java, making it suitable for those with intermediate Java experience. It demonstrates the application of computational methods to long-range climate pattern predictions, which is an essential skill for those seeking careers in meteorology, climate science, or related fields.

Each project folder contains the Java source code, a detailed description.txt file explaining the project's objectives and requirements, and any necessary input/output files or additional resources.

Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the "CS 111 Projects" folder. Within each project folder, you can find instructions on how to compile and run the Java programs using a Java Development Kit (JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or command line.
