# CS 111 Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of the CS 111 course at Rutgers University. The projects are written in Java and demonstrate the programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms taught throughout the course. Each project folder contains a detailed description of the project's objectives, requirements, and implementation details.

# Usage Instructions:
Make sure to download the "inputOutput" folder and place its contents in the same directory as the programs you intend to execute. It is important to note that you should not just place the folder itself, but rather transfer the contents of the folder to the target directory. Several programs in this repository rely on the classes contained within the "inputOutput" folder for their proper functioning.

## Projects Overview
Below is a brief overview of the projects included in the "CS 111 Projects" folder:

### 1. Polygon Transformer
This Java program is a library of static methods designed to perform geometric transformations on polygons, such as scaling, translation, and rotation. The program requires a strong understanding of linear algebra, trigonometry, and familiarity with Java's Math class to work with angles in radians and degrees. This project demonstrates the ability to create reusable code for complex mathematical operations and is suitable for those with intermediate Java experience.

### 2. Weather Generator
This Java program is a weather forecast generator and analyzer, demonstrating skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and probability theory. A solid foundation in Java programming and a basic understanding of computer science concepts are necessary to successfully implement this project. The program simulates daily weather patterns based on historical weather data, providing long-range climate trend predictions. It processes two input files containing the probabilities of weather transitioning from dry to wet and wet to wet. Key functionality includes generating a one-month forecast, counting wet and dry days, identifying the longest wet or dry spell, and determining the best week to travel based on dry days.

**### 3. Art Collage**
This Java program demonstrates skills in digital image manipulation, array processing, and object-oriented programming by creating artistic collages from digital images. Utilizing the Picture and Color classes for handling digital images and colors, the program offers functionality such as scaling images, generating collages from image tiles, replacing tiles with other images, colorizing tiles, and converting tiles to grayscale.


### General Information:
Each project folder contains the Java source code, a detailed README.md file explaining the project's objectives and requirements, and any necessary input/output files or additional resources.

Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the "CS 111 Projects" folder. Within each project folder, you can find instructions on how to compile and run the Java programs using a Java Development Kit (JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or command line.
