## Weather Generator
The Weather Generator is a Java program that simulates and analyzes weather forecasts, focusing on predicting whether a day will be "wet" (with measurable precipitation) or "dry." The program requires knowledge of probability, statistics, and data manipulation in Java, making it suitable for those with intermediate Java experience. It demonstrates the application of computational methods to long-range climate pattern predictions, which is an essential skill for those seeking careers in meteorology, climate science, or related fields.

Weather Generator: A Java Library for Weather Forecast Simulations and Analysis
The Weather Generator is a Java program that simulates and analyzes weather forecasts, with an emphasis on predicting whether a day will be "wet" (having measurable precipitation) or "dry." To implement this program, a strong foundation in probability, statistics, and data manipulation using Java is necessary. The project showcases the application of computational techniques to predict long-range climate patterns, which is crucial for those pursuing careers in meteorology, climate science, or related fields.

The program relies on historical weather data, including the probability of a day being wet or dry based on the previous day's weather and the time of year. The program uses the statistical characteristics of observed weather at a given location to simulate future weather patterns.

Key features of the Weather Generator include:

Populating location probabilities: Reads weather data from text files and populates arrays with probabilities for a specific location.
Forecast generation: Predicts future precipitation patterns for one month using historical probabilities and random numbers.
One-month forecast: Combines previous methods to prepare data and predict weather for an entire month.
Number of wet/dry days: Calculates the number of wet or dry days in a given month's forecast.
Length of longest wet/dry spell: Identifies the longest wet or dry spell in a given month's forecast.
Best week to travel: Determines the 7-day period with the most dry days, which can be useful for travel planning.
The Weather Generator program is ideal for those with intermediate Java experience seeking to apply computational methods to real-world problems, such as long-range weather prediction
