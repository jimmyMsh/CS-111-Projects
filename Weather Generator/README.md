## Weather Generator: A Java Library for Weather Forecast Simulations and Analysis

The Weather Generator is a Java program that simulates and analyzes weather forecasts, with an emphasis on predicting whether a day will be "wet" (having measurable precipitation) or "dry." To implement this program, a strong foundation in probability, statistics, and data manipulation using Java is necessary. The project showcases the application of computational techniques to predict long-range climate patterns, which is crucial for those pursuing careers in meteorology, climate science, or related fields.

The program relies on historical weather data, including the probability of a day being wet or dry based on the previous day's weather and the time of year. The program uses the statistical characteristics of observed weather at a given location to simulate future weather patterns.

Key features of the Weather Generator include:

<strong>Populating location probabilities:</strong> Reads weather data from text files and populates arrays with probabilities for a specific location. <br>
<strong>Forecast generation:</strong> Predicts future precipitation patterns for one month using historical probabilities and random numbers.
<br>
<strong>One-month forecast:</strong> Combines previous methods to prepare data and predict weather for an entire month.
<br>
<strong>Number of wet/dry days</strong> Calculates the number of wet or dry days in a given month's forecast.
<br>
<strong>Length of longest wet/dry spell:</strong> Identifies the longest wet or dry spell in a given month's forecast.
<br>
<strong>Best week to travel:</strong> Determines the 7-day period with the most dry days, which can be useful for travel planning.
<br>
The Weather Generator program is ideal for those with intermediate Java experience seeking to apply computational methods to real-world problems, such as long-range weather prediction. It demonstrates the ability to manipulate and analyze complex data sets, which is an essential skill for careers in meteorology, climate science, and other related fields.
