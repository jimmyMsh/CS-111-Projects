## Art Collage Creator: A Java Program for Image Manipulation and Collage Creation
This project involves working with digital images represented as rectangular grids of pixels, with each pixel's color encoded using the Color data type based on the RGB color model. The Picture class is utilized for handling digital images, and the Color class is used for manipulating color properties of the image.

Key features of Art Collage include:

- **One-argument and three-arguments constructors:** Initialize the original and collage pictures with specified dimensions, adapting to various image sizes and resolutions.

- **scale:** Efficiently scale the original image to fit the collage picture size, preserving the aspect ratio and image quality.

- **makeCollage:** Create a visually engaging collage of tiles by scaling down the original picture and seamlessly repeating the tile in the image, providing an artistic effect.

- **replaceTile:** Enhance the collage by replacing a specific tile in the collage picture with another image, allowing for customization and personalization of the final output.

- **colorizeTile:** Apply red, green, or blue color filters to a tile in the collage picture, adding a creative touch and altering the overall appearance of the collage.

- **grayscaleTile:** Convert a tile of the collage picture to grayscale, creating a classic, timeless look by using a provided method for calculating grayscale values.


This project demonstrates an ability to work with digital images, manipulate their properties, and create custom collages by implementing various image processing techniques using Java programming language.

### How to Run the Art Collage Creator

**Note**: To run the Art Collage Creator program, you must first compile and run the **Driver** file. The **Driver** file is designed to interactively test the methods and functionality provided by the **Collage** class. The **Collage** class contains all the methods described in the detailed description above, which are used for image manipulation and collage creation.
